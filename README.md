This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to implicit type conversion during arithmetic operations involving strings. The `bug.php` file shows how a seemingly simple addition operation can produce unexpected results due to PHP's automatic conversion of strings to numbers.  The `bugSolution.php` file offers a solution using explicit type checking and conversion to ensure accurate and predictable results.
