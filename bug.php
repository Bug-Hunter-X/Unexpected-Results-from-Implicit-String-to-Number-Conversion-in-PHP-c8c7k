In PHP, a common yet easily overlooked error stems from the implicit conversion of strings to numbers in arithmetic operations.  If you attempt to add a string containing a number to an integer, PHP will attempt to convert the string to an integer before performing the addition. This can lead to unexpected results if the string doesn't start with a valid numerical value.

For instance:
```php
$stringNum = "10abc";
$intNum = 5;
$result = $stringNum + $intNum; // $result will be 10, not 15
```
The string "10abc" will be implicitly converted to the integer 10, and the addition will proceed as expected. However, if the string does not begin with a valid numerical value, it will convert to 0.

```php
$stringNum = "abc10";
$intNum = 5;
$result = $stringNum + $intNum; // $result will be 5, not 15
```
This behavior can be very difficult to detect, especially in large code bases.
